This is a library for quickly pulling together a set of BLE device tests for end-of-line testing.

BLE Tests are generically specified with a test name, description and a set of BLE commands to send (reads or writes).

The library displays a view which lists pass/fail of tests for a single device. It also maintains a count of failures across tests.

The API currently involves extending the DeviceTestActivity class to define your own tests and set your app title. An example app has been put together here.
